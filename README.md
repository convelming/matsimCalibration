This is an MATSim exntesion for bahaviours calibration. 
With labeled data such as trips collected from survey or LBS data, this extension will calibrate the parameters in planCalcScore module.
Further information will be modified in the future if more people find it useful, and when I get the time and mood. Please let me know if you wanna use it.
and they will be future versions to use parallel computing, if I could find projects to support it.
